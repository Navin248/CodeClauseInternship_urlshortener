This Python code provides a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) for shortening URLs using the pyshorteners library. It streamlines the URL shortening process and offers convenient copying functionality.

Features:

Graphical Interface: Interact with the URL shortener visually using a user-friendly GUI.
URL Shortening: Enter your long URL, and the application will generate its shortened version.
Automatic Shortening: The short URL is automatically displayed in a designated field.
Clipboard Copying: Easily copy the shortened URL to your clipboard with a single click.
Installation:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3 and pip (the package manager for Python) installed on your system. You can download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install pip by following the instructions on the website.

Install Required Libraries: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Then, run the following command:

Bash
pip install pyshorteners pyperclip tkinter
Use code with caution.

Usage:

Clone or Download the Repository: If you haven't already, clone or download the repository containing the code files.

Run the Script: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute the following command to launch the application:

Bash
python url_shortener.py  # Replace 'url_shortener.py' with your actual file name if different
Use code with caution.

Explanation of the Code:

Import Libraries:

pyshorteners: Used to shorten URLs.
pyperclip: Enables copying the shortened URL to the clipboard.
tkinter: Provides the framework for building the GUI.
Define GUI Window:

root = Tk(): Creates the main window for the application.
root.geometry("400x200"): Sets the window's size to 400 pixels wide and 200 pixels high.
root.title("URL Shortener"): Sets the title displayed on the window's frame.
root.configure(bg="black"): Sets the background color of the window to black (customize as desired).
Create String Variables:

url = StringVar(): Stores the long URL entered by the user.
url_address = StringVar(): Stores the shortened URL generated by the application.
Define URL Shortening Function:

urlshortener(): This function is triggered when the "Generate Short URL" button is clicked.
urladdress = url.get(): Retrieves the long URL from the input field.
url_short = pyshorteners.Shortener().tinyurl.short(urladdress): Shortens the long URL using the TinyURL service from pyshorteners and stores the result in url_short.
url_address.set(url_short): Updates the url_address variable with the shortened URL, which will be displayed in the corresponding entry field.
Define URL Copying Function:

copyurl(): This function is called when the "Copy URL" button is clicked.
url_short = url_address.get(): Retrieves the shortened URL from the url_address variable.
pyperclip.copy(url_short): Copies the shortened URL to the clipboard, allowing you to easily paste it elsewhere.
Create GUI Elements:

Label(root , text="My URL Shortener" , font="poppins").pack(pady=10): Adds a title label to the window with custom padding.
Entry(root, textvariable=url).pack(pady=5): Creates an input field where the user can enter the long URL. The value entered is stored in the url variable.
Button(root, text="Generate Short URL", command=urlshortener).pack(pady=7): Creates a button labeled "Generate Short URL" that triggers the urlshortener() function when clicked.
Entry(root, textvariable=url_address).pack(pady=5): Creates a read-only input field where the shortened URL is displayed. The value is retrieved from the url_address variable.
Button(root, text="Copy URL",command=copyurl).pack(pady=5): Creates a button labeled "Copy URL" that triggers the `
